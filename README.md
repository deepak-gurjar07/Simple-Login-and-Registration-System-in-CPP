# Simple-Login-and-Registration-System-in-CPP

This is a simple console-based C++ program that allows users to register and log in. It provides basic functionality for user registration and authentication using a username and password.

## Features

**User Registration**: Users can create an account by selecting the "Register" option. They can choose a username and password, which will be stored securely.

**User Login**: Registered users can log in using their username and password. The program verifies their credentials against the stored data.

## Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to choose between registration and login.

If you select "Register," you can create a new account by choosing a username and password.

If you select "Login," you can log in using your previously registered credentials.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with file creation or access, make sure you have the necessary permissions for the directory where user data is stored (the "data" directory).
